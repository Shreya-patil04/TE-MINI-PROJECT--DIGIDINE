# Digi_Dine --> Wireless E-Menu and Kitchen Feedback System
I developed Digi-Dine, a wireless digital ordering system that replaces manual order taking with an ESP32-based E-menu, improving order accuracy and customer experience. On the customer side, menu items are displayed on an OLED display, and selections are made using a 4x4 keypad configured with matrix scanning and ESP32 GPIOs. The ESP32 processes the input and sends order data to a Node.js server using Wi-Fi and API calls with authentication tokens. On the chef side, orders are received, stored in MongoDB, and displayed on a live web dashboard built using JavaScript for real-time monitoring. I worked on ESP32 configuration, keypad and OLED interfacing, Wi-Fi communication, API integration, and end-to-end system testing to ensure reliable customer-to-kitchen communication.
